This is my solution for [Young Capital's](https://youngcapital.nl) code test.

## TASK
Write a function to calculate the cost of travelling between stations along a route (an array of stations).
The trip can be in any direction of the route.

## RUN FUNCTION

In your CLI console, cd into the solution directory and run `node function.js`. The CLI would display a log of the calculated fare.

The `review.json` file contains an array of stations with both `name` and `passFare`(cost of passing through the station) properties.

The `function.js` file contains all the code/functions.  Line `120` is the main call to run the function.
Edit the two parameters passed by entering any other two station names from the `review.json` list.
Entering a station name, not on the list displays a notice. Also, entering the same names for both parameters informs you that no fare is being charged.
