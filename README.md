This is my solution for [Young Capital's](https://youngcapital.nl) code test.

## TASK
Write a function to calculate the cost of travelling between stations along a route (an array of stations).
The trip can be in any direction of the route.

## RUN FUNCTION

In your CLI console, cd into the solution directory and run `npm install` to install jest.
Then, run `npm run test`. The CLI would display a log of the test results from tests in `get-ride-cost.test.js`.

The `review.json` file contains an array of stations with both `name` and `passFare`(cost of passing through the station) properties.

The `get-ride-cost.js` file contains the exported `getRideCost` function.

Tests are listed in `get-ride-cost.test.js`.
